# Flappy Emmies - Unity WebGL Game

This is my first Unity game, a browser-based Flappy Bird-inspired game featuring my dear Emmies. You can play the game online at [Flappy Emmies](https://fishballsandwich.github.io/Flappy_Emmies_Unity_WebGL/).

This is one of my many dying side projects that I lost motivations to wrap up so please brace yourself for (a lot of) bugs.

**Disclaimer:** I do not own any of the images or assets used in this project. They are used for educational and non-commercial purposes.

Enjoy playing Flappy Emmies! 🎮🐤🏆
